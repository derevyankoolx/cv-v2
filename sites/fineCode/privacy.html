        characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Services.

        We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information
        does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage
        information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language
        preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our
        Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and

        third parties.

        Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers. We may share your data with third-party vendors,
        service providers, contractors, or agents ("third parties") who perform services for us or on our behalf and

        or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us.

        4. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?

        In Short: We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you share with third parties that we may
        link to or who advertise on our Services, but are not affiliated with, our Services.

        The Services may link to third-party websites, online services, or mobile applications and/or contain
        advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites,
        services, or applications. Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we
        will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or
        applications. The inclusion of a link towards a third-party website, service, or application does not imply an
        endorsement by us. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data
        collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible for the content or
        privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services, or
        applications that may be linked to or from the Services. You should review the policies of such third parties
        and contact them directly to respond to your questions.

        5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?

        In Short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.

        We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store
        information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is
        set out in our Cookie Notice.

        6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

        In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy
        notice unless otherwise required by law.

        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
        privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or
        other legal requirements).

        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
        anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
        stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
        further processing until deletion is possible.

        7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?

        In Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.

        If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you
        also have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection authority.

        If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.

        Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be
        express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at
        any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in
        the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.

        However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when
        applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on
        lawful processing grounds other than consent.

        Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can
        usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or
        reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services. You may also opt out of
        interest-based advertising by advertisers on our Services.

        If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at finecodeua@gmail.com.

        8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
        feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
        browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
        implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
        other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
        tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
        version of this privacy notice.

        9. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?

        In Short: Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your
        personal information.

        California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are
        California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories
        of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and
        addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar
        year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in
        writing to us using the contact information provided below.

        If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with Services, you have
        the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request removal of such
        data, please contact us using the contact information provided below and include the email address associated
        with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly
        displayed on the Services, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed
        from all our systems (e.g., backups, etc.).

        10. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?

        In Short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.

        We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated
        "Revised" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material
        changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by
        directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of
        how we are protecting your information.
